## Install

All instructions can be found at [draculatheme.com/atom](https://draculatheme.com/atom).

## Issues

If you are running into an issue where Atom is constantly asking you to update the package, it may have to do with the rename from `dracula-theme` to `dracula-syntax`. Uninstalling `dracula-theme` and `dracula-syntax` and reinstalling `dracula-syntax` should fix this problem.
